# Chess Clock

Nothing really useful, just me playing with android, trying to build a chess clock based on tilting the phone :P


A chess clock that works by tilting your phone. Put your phone onto something that can be tilted and instead of pressing
a button on your chess clock, tilt the phone towards you.
