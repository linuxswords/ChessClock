# Chess Clock

Started as a weekend project, trying to build a chess clock app based on tilting the phone :P
inspired by tempest clock.


A chess clock that works by tilting your phone. Put your phone onto something that can be tilted and instead of pressing
a button on your chess clock.



## ideas

* [ ] store your last time setting (profile)
* [ ] settings: add sound effects
* [ ] analog clock?
* [ ] simple tap could activate meta info like current time setting/info etc? But I like the single tap pause function

## todos

* [ ] better picture
* [x] show current time setting on front screen
* [x] double tab to reset clock
* [x] avoid flickering/to-quick-switches by lowering sensibility
* [x] implement increment
* [x] fix increment bug at start
* [x] Clock-UI without buttons
* [x] use alpha instead of background change when tilting
* [x] ~~settings: configure tilting threshold~~ figured out a better way to measure tilts
